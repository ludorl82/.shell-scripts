# Shell Scripts

The shell is an Ubuntu 20.04 VMware virtual machine with docker to run the console and all tools to work in the terminal.

The console is a so-called terminal running in a docker container with access to its host docker socket to run other docker containers with specific tools (ie ansible, terraform, kubectl).

Termux is an exploratory solution for working from Android devices.
